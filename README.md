### Hi Everyone! 👋

👩‍💻 **Welcome! I’m Nayeon, a Passionate Data Scientist** with over two years of academic experience in Statistics and more than a year of practical work as a Statistical Analyst in a government organization. I am committed to making the world a better place through data-driven decisions.

📚 **My Expertise Lies in Causal Inference,** where I have conducted quantitative analyses, such as evaluating the causal effect of urban parks on children's happiness. My technical skills include:

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Data Manipulation & Querying:** SQL - Oracle, PostgreSQL
- **Continuous Learning:** I stay up-to-date with the latest technologies through self-directed learning.

🔎 **I’m Actively Seeking** a full-time position as a Junior Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. I’m eager to join a company that values inclusivity and offers opportunities for growth and development.
