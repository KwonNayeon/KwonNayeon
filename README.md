📚 My field of study is causal inference, and I have knowledge in statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. I have experience working with programming languages such as R, Python, and SQL, and I'm always keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies through self-learning.

📈 I use GitHub to upload "Today I Learned" notes and share my learning journey with others. I'm passionate about discovering insights hidden within data and enjoy working on various projects in my spare time.
