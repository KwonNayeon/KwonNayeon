### Hi everyone 👋

👩‍💻 **As a self-motivated Data Scientist** with over two years of academic experience in Statistics and over a year of practical work as a Statistical Analyst in a government organization, I am driven to make the world a better place through data-driven decisions.

📚 **My field of study is causal inference**, and I conducted a quantitative analysis on the causal effect of urban parks on children's happiness using my problem-solving skills. I have statistics expertise and experience working with R and Python. Additionally, I have extensive experience with SQL for data manipulation and querying. I stay up-to-date with the latest technologies through self-directed learning.

🔎 I am currently seeking a full-time position as a Junior Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer in a company that values inclusivity and offers opportunities for growth and development.
